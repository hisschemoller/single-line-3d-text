## Minimal 3D text for Three.js apps
For another project I need text labels to be displayed in a three.js 3D scene. I'd like the characters to be as simple as possible, so they take up minimal resources, and the processor can dedicate itself to more important tasks as 3D animations and steady timing.

The font for the game Asteroids is very basic, and is the one I chose.
